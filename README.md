6. Model Training
7. Choose best model
8. Save the best model
9. Pipline for data ingestion
10. Pipeline for base model training
11. Prediction pipeline
12. Creating index and home pages
13. Docker Image generation and uploading on AWS ECR
14. Configuring Github Workflows
15. Deploying Docker Image on EC2 instance

## 1) Problem statement
This project understands how the student’s performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preparation course.
## 2) Data Collection
The data was collected from Student_Performance_Data on Kaggle
## 3) Data Checks to perform
1. Check Missing values
2. Check Duplicates
3. Check data type
4. Check the number of unique values of each column
5. Check statistics of data set
6. Check various categories present in the different categorical column
## Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:
